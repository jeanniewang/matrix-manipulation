# HOW TO RUN THIS APP
- Go to root folder (./League_coding_challenge) and install all dependances:
    ```
    npm install
    node app.js
    ```
Given an uploaded csv file (matrix.csv)
    - The input file to these functions is a matrix, of any dimension where the number of rows are equal to the number of columns (square). Each value is an integer, and there is no header row. matrix.csv is example valid input.  
    ```
    1,2,3
    4,5,6
    7,8,9
    ```
1. Echo (given)
    - Return the matrix as a string in matrix format.
    ```
    curl "http://localhost:8080/echo?path=matrix.csv"
    ``` 
    - Expected return
    ```
    {"matrix":[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]}
    ``` 
2. Invert
    - Return the matrix as a string in matrix format where the columns and rows are inverted
    ```
    curl "http://localhost:8080/invert?path=matrix.csv"
    ``` 
    - Expected return
    ```
    {"Inverted matrix":[[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]}
    ``` 

3. Flatten
    - Return the matrix as a 1 line string, with values separated by commas.
    ```
    curl "http://localhost:8080/flatten?path=matrix.csv"
    ``` 
    - Expected return
    ```
    {"Flatten matrix":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]}
    ``` 
4. Sum
    - Return the sum of the integers in the matrix
    ```
    curl "http://localhost:8080/sum?path=matrix.csv"
    45
    ``` 
    - Expected return
    ```
    {"Flatten matrix":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]}
    ``` 

5. Multiply
    - Return the product of the integers in the matrix
        ```
        curl "http://localhost:8080/multiply?path=matrix.csv"
        ``` 
        - Expected return
        ```
        {"Multiplication of this matrix":362880}
    ``` 
6. Handle exception
    - This matrix contains element that is not a number
        ```
        // Given an uploaded csv file
        1,2,3
        1,2,3
        4,5,f
        ``` 
        ```
        curl "http://localhost:8080/echo?path=test/matrixIncludeNonNumber.csv"
        ``` 
        ```
        // Expected return
        {"error":"This matrix contains element that is not a number"}
        ``` 

    - The data in the input file is Not a matrix
        ```
        // Given an uploaded csv file
        1,2,3
        1,2
        ``` 
        ```
        curl "http://localhost:8080/echo?path=test/matrixFaulty.csv"
        ``` 
        ```
        // Expected return
        {"error":"This is NOT a matrix"}
        ```
    - The number of rows are NOT equal to the number of columns in this matrix
        ```
        // Given an uploaded csv file
        1,2,3,4
        1,2,3,4
        4,5,6,4
        ``` 
        ```
        curl "http://localhost:8080/echo?path=test/matrixnonsquare.csv"
        ``` 
        ```
        // Expected return
        {"error":"The number of rows are NOT equal to the number of columns in this matrix"}
        ```
    - The Echo function is robust and can trim element in this matrix
        ```
        // Given an uploaded csv file
        1,2, 3  
        4,  5  ,6
        7,8 ,9
        ``` 
        ```
        curl "http://localhost:8080/echo?path=test/matrixfortriming.csv"
        ``` 
        ```
        // Expected return
        {"matrix":[[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]}
        ```


# Unit test for all the core functions: Echo, Invert, Flatten, Sum, Multiply
- Go to root folder (./League_coding_challenge):
    ```
    mocha .\test\matrixManipulation.spec.js
    ```
